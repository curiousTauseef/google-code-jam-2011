 * @FIXME This code doesn't produce the correct output
 * Problem C. Perfect Harmony
 * http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=1128486#s=p2
 * 
 *        Problem
 * 
 *        Jeff is a part of the great Atlantean orchestra. Each player of the
 *        orchestra has already decided what sound will he play (for the sake of
 *        simplicity we assume each player plays only one sound). We say two
 *        sounds are in harmony if the frequency of any one of them divides the
 *        frequency of the other (that's a pretty restrictive idea of harmony,
 *        but the Atlanteans are known to be very conservative in music). Jeff
 *        knows that the notes played by other players are not necessarily in
 *        harmony with each other. He wants his own note to improve the
 *        symphony, so he wants to choose his note so that it is in harmony with
 *        the notes all the other players play.
 * 
 *        Now, this sounds simple (as all the frequencies are positive integers,
 *        it would be enough for Jeff to play the note with frequency 1, or,
 *        from the other side, the Least Common Multiple of all the other
 *        notes), but unfortunately Jeff's instrument has only a limited range
 *        of notes available. Help Jeff find out if playing a note harmonious
 *        with all others is possible.
 * 
 *        Input
 * 
 *        The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test
 *        cases follow. Each test case is described by two lines. The first
 *        contains three numbers: N, L and H, denoting the number of other
 *        players, the lowest and the highest note Jeff's instrument can play.
 *        The second line contains N integers denoting the frequencies of notes
 *        played by the other players.
 * 
 *        Output
 * 
 *        For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x
 *        is the case number (starting from 1) and y is either the string "NO"
 *        (if Jeff cannot play an appropriate note), or a possible frequency. If
 *        there are multiple frequencies Jeff could play, output the lowest one.
 * 
 *        Limits
 * 
 *        1 ≤ T ≤ 40.
 * 
 *        Small dataset
 * 
 *        1 ≤ N ≤ 100. 
 *        1 ≤ L ≤ H ≤ 10000. 
 *        All the frequencies are no larger than 10000.
 * 
 *        Large dataset
 * 
 *        1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4. 
 *        1 ≤ L ≤ H ≤ 10^16 
 *        All the frequencies are no larger than 10^16
 * 
 *        Sample
 * 
 *        Input 
 *        2 
 *        3 2 100
 *        3 5 7
 *        4 8 16
 *        1 20 5 2
 * 
 *        Output 
 *        Case #1: NO 
 *        Case #2: 10
